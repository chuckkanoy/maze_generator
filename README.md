# ðŸšªMaze GeneratorðŸšª

There are two parts to this project: a maze generator, and a game called Netrunning.

## Installation

This project can be accessed locally via the following command: `git clone https://github.com/chuckkanoy/maze_generator.git`

## Maze

This part of the project is a maze generator that uses the Depth First Search algorithm for generation. It comes complete with a draw function that displays an image of a maze that you can save if you'd like.

### Using Maze

This part of the project can be run using the following command: `python maze.py`

## Netrunning

I made this part of the project because I can't resist gamifying projects. The main game loop is that you control a cyberpunk netrunner through the "Net" (i.e. the maze itself) to the destination cell.

### Using Netrunning

This part of the project can be run using the following command: `python netrunning.py`. You could also navigate to the following executable: `distribute\NETRUNNING\NETRUNNING.exe`.
